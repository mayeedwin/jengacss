Author : Maye Edwin / Mode : Draft

### ðŸŽ¯ Performance is key 
 
You only import and use 
**a css component** that you need for every page. ***Jenga*** is a Kiswahili word meaning ***Build*** in English.

### ðŸŽ¯ Power of css variables

Jenga is powered by **CSS Variables** which results to less repetition, better readability and more flexibility. Plus, unlike variables from CSS preprocessors, they're actually a part of the DOM, which has a lot of benefits.

### ðŸŽ¯ Code splitting, component splitting

With **component-level** code-splitting, you can move individual components into separate assets chunks. On particular events, you can load the relevant styles and scripts and render the components.

### ðŸŽ¯ Editing on the go, increase productivity

**Component Level** implementation of your css increases your Productivity when it comes to cleaning up code, enhancing a component or editing generally whether in your code editor or within your favourite browser's dev tools. 

### ðŸŽ¯ Native user interface for PWAs

Jenga authored components are built with **Native UI** design approach for building amazing user interfaces for your progressive web apps. We are calling this [Progressive Web User Interface](https://pwafire.org/developer/docs/progressive-user-interface/).
